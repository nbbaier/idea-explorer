## Codebase Patterns

- Use `getSandbox` from `@cloudflare/sandbox` to create sandbox instances
- Export `Sandbox` from index.ts for Cloudflare container runtime
- Prompts are stored in `/prompts/` directory and copied into container
- SPEC.md contains the complete API specification and framework templates

---

# Progress Log

## Initial State Assessment
- Dockerfile exists with sandbox base image, but uses 5-min timeout instead of 15-min
- Prompts (business.md, exploration.md) already created
- Basic worker exists with POST endpoint for repo/task, needs refactoring for idea exploration API
- wrangler.jsonc configured for containers
