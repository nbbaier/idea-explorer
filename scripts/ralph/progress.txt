## Codebase Patterns
- Prompts are stored in `/prompts/` directory at project root
- Use `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript compilation

- Verified existing prompt templates match SPEC.md requirements
- Files: prompts/business.md, prompts/exploration.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Prompt templates were already created and just needed verification
  - Both prompts follow same pattern: Instructions, Output Template, Input Variables sections
